          <h2>Blue Ridge Literacy</h2>
          <p>
            I am proud to collaborate with <a href="https://www.blueridgeliteracy.org/">Blue Ridge Literacy</a>, a key
            community ally in our research endeavors. This organization is dedicated to empowering refugees and
            immigrants by providing essential resources and support. Our joint effort focuses on addressing the specific
            needs of learners in their Citizenship Class. To this end, we are developing a mobile application.
            This project is built upon focus groups with Blue Ridge Literacy, ensuring that the app's
            features are perfectly aligned with the learners' requirements and provide effective support in their
            naturalization
            journey.

          <h2>Peer Mentoring</h2>
          <p> In the Fall, I mentor first-year engineering students. I'm passionate about helping new Hokies settle into
            college life. In this role, I act as both a friend and a student advisor, aiming to make their transition
            smoother and less daunting. My focus is on supporting these students as they embark on the demanding yet
            rewarding path of engineering studies.

          <h2>Center for Enanchment of Engineering Diversity</h2>
          <p>In the Summer, I was an RA for engineering summer camps. I interacted with middle
            and high school students from across Virginia. These students stayed on campus to engage in various
            engineering classes and activities, fostering their interest in STEM fields. My role was crucial in managing
            their experiences outside the classroom. I focused on overseeing their well-being, facilitating the
            formation of meaningful relationships, especially with underrepresented students. Additionally, I handled
            the responsibilities typical of an RA, including resolving disputes and ensuring a supportive, fun, and safe
            environment for all camp participants.

          <h2>Society of Women Engineers</h2>
          <p> Society of Women Engineers is a club on campus that provides a supportive platform for women in
            engineering
            to learn, connect, and grow. As a member of the Education Outreach Committee, I had the unique opportunity
            to engage with young women in our community, inspiring them to explore the field of Engineering. One of my
            key contributions was delivering a talk to girl scouts about computing. In this talk, I shared my personal
            experiences and insights as a woman in the computing field, aiming to encourage and motivate them to
            consider careers in technology and engineering.
